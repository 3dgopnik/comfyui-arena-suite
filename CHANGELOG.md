## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Extend Arena AutoCache index metadata to expose byte totals and the last HIT/MISS/TRIM/COPY event.
### Docs
- Document the Impact Pack dependency and credit ltdrdata in the README install instructions.
- Note that autocache nodes return disabled stubs when `ARENA_CACHE_ENABLE=0`.
- Describe the expanded AutoCache stats and trim JSON payloads in `custom_nodes/ComfyUI_Arena/README.md`.
### Fixed
- Aggregate Arena node and display mapping exports at the package root so ComfyUI can discover nodes even when optional submodules fail to import.
- Allow cache lookups to fall back to source files when `.copying` locks persist and clean up stale locks before retrying copies.
- Retry cache population after clearing stale `.copying` locks so the cache path is reused on the next request.
- Recreate cache entries when stale files with mismatched sizes are detected during reuse.
- Prevent cache readers from using files protected by `.copying` locks to avoid partial reads.
- Ensure cache copy failures clean up partial files and surface errors for retry.
- Serialize cache index updates to prevent data races during concurrent access.
- Restore package-level exports so ComfyUI can import `comfyui-arena-suite` from `custom_nodes`.
- Keep cache helpers importable and return stub responses when the cache is disabled.
